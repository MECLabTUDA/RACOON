            New Version: mask and x are lists of paths to images/segmentations

            mask (numpy.Array): an int32 numpy array for a segmentation mask,
                with dimensions (channels, width, height, depth). The 'channels'
                dimension corresponds to the number of labels, the other
                dimensions should be the same as for x. All entries are 0 or 1.
            x (numpy.Array): a float64 numpy array for a 3D image, normalized so
                that all values are between 0 and 1. The array follows the
                dimensions (channels, width, height, depth), where channels == 1

        Returns (dict[str -> float]): a dictionary linking metric names to float
            quality estimates
